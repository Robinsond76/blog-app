# blog-app
A blog-app using JSON Server to practice React and React Context

This is a simple and elegant Blog website to practice React and React Context.

React Context has been optimized to be used in the best possible way, including seperating the Dispatch and State into two different contexts to prevent components that only uses the dispatch from re-rendering. 

React.Memo is also used to prevent unchanged blogs from rerendering.
